This project analyzes the growth and seasonal patterns of UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions in India using ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) time-series modeling. The dataset consists of historical monthly UPI transaction records, including volume and value. The data is preprocessed through cleaning, handling missing values, and converting timestamps into a usable time-series format. ACF and PACF plots are used to determine appropriate values of p, d, and q parameters for building the ARIMA model.
The trained ARIMA model is then used to capture trends and temporal dependencies in UPI transactions. Using this model, future transaction volumes are forecasted to understand expected digital payment growth. The results show that the ARIMA model effectively predicts short-term fluctuations and provides strong insight into increasing digital payment adoption. The project demonstrates practical time-series forecasting using ARIMA for financial and digital economy datasets.
